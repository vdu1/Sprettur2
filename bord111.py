This program is right on the borderline between being acceptable as a list/dict of lists and being better off written with classes. If there's any possibility that it will grow, you'd probably want to reorganize it as an object oriented program (OOP), like this:

import sys
import random

class Question(object):
    def __init__(self, question, answer, options):
        self.question = question
        self.answer = answer
        self.options = options

    def ask(self):
        print self.question + "?"
        for n, option in enumerate(self.options):
            print "%d) %s" % (n + 1, option)

        response = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())   # answers are integers
        if response == self.answer:
            print "CORRECT"
        else:
            print "wrong"

questions = [
    Question("How many legs on a horse", 4, ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"]),
    Question("How many wheels on a bicycle", 2, ["one", "two", "three", "twenty-six"]),

    # more verbose formatting
    Question(question="What colour is a swan in Australia",
             answer=1,
             options=["black", "white", "pink"]),    # the last one can have a comma, too
    ]

random.shuffle(questions)    # randomizes the order of the questions

for question in questions:
    question.ask()
